ðŸ§­ Swipe Detection Not Working?
If swipe detection isn't working as expected, make sure you're viewing the scene in the Simulator tab instead of the Game tab.

âœ… Note: Unityâ€™s Input.touches and multi-touch input may not work properly in the Game view. Switch to Simulator view (available from the drop-down above the Game tab) to test swipe functionality on touch devices.
